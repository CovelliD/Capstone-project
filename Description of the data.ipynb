The final assessment is based on the ability of the cities to attract foreigners and look appealing to members of the international community. The most common venues of the last two cities are identified with the Foursquare API. The k-means algorithm is then used to cluster venue categories. A final assessment of quantitative (number of venues) and qualitative (venue categories) variables is performed to determine the city that best suits the needs of the corporation. "
